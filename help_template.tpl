<h1>Usage</h1>
<h4>Version: 0.2</h4>
<p>Used to launch scans using the Nessus Cloud Scanner</p>
<p>The only information that needs to be entered is the host to scan,
policy ID, and scannerID that are listed in the tables above them.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the disp.py file the only changes that need to be changed are the Nessus
API keys, and the HOST= variable.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some things to still be added:
  error checking before submitting values to Nessus,
  name field for tracking scan names,
  logging
